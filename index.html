            <h2>9/7/2020</h2>
            <p>This is my first attemp at creating a website using html, CSS and Javasript. I have learned about primitive data sets (BUNNS), and the difference between (var)(let) and (consts) I have also come to learn that Javascript employs a short hand for its variable strings</p>
            <p></p2>
            <ul>
                <li>&& is equal to "and" . . . oh, and a string needs to capture its numbers as a "", or is it the other way around? I'll have to look that up</li>
                <li>|| is equal to "or"</li>
                <li>|| is equal to "or"</li>
                <li>! is equal to "not"</li>
                <li>> is equal to "greater than"</li>
                <li>< is equal to "less than"</li>
                <li>>=is equal to "greater than or equal to"</li>
                <li><=is equal to "less than or equal to"</li>
                <li>=== is equal to "equals"</li>
                <li>== is equal to (shorthand for) "equals" ("" numbers are a primitive data set "")</li>
            </ul> 
    
            <p>So, I ought to be able to to arrange paragraphs, headers and lists fairly well by now. I think my next goal is to style things a little bit, and then: display a live temperature</p>
